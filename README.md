 # Overview
  In this model, I have taken [Fer2013 dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013) which has 3 coloums namely Emotion,pixel(48x48) and usage(labeled as           Training ,public test and private test)<br>
  Here i have applied Convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform the task and constructed a CNN using Keras and Tensorflow.<br>
  
  <br>
  I first used mean standardization but the results were not accurate ,next i used the min-max standardization which somewhat improved the acuracy of prediction
